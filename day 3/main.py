# loops

# only two types of loops in python for and while

# for loop used when number of iterations is known

# name = "Kunal"
# for i in range(5):
#     print(name)

# for i in range(1, 6):
#     print(i)

# for i in range(1, 11):
#     print("2 *", i, "=", 2 * i)

# while loop used when number of iterations is not known

# count = 0
# while count < 5:
#     print("Hello World")
#     count += 1

# total = 0
# num = 1
# while num <= 5:
#     total += num
#     num += 1
# print("Sum of Total:", total)

# for i in range(1, 11):
#     if i % 2 == 0:
#         continue
#     print(i)
